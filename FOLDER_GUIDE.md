rm -rf .cache
rm -rf .config
rm -rf .local

# Composer packages (regenerate with composer install)
rm -rf vendor

# NPM packages (regenerate with npm install)
rm -rf node_modules

# Laravel cache (regenerate automatically)
rm -rf bootstrap/cache/*
rm -rf storage/framework/cache/*
rm -rf storage/framework/sessions/*
rm -rf storage/framework/views/*

rm -rf storage/logs/*
```

### ❌ DO NOT DELETE:

## 🧹 Complete Cleanup Script

Create a cleanup script:

**cleanup.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "🧹 Cleaning up Laravel project..."

# Remove Composer cache/config (auto-generated)
echo "Removing Composer cache..."
rm -rf .cache .config .local

# Clear Laravel caches
echo "Clearing Laravel caches..."
rm -rf bootstrap/cache/*
rm -rf storage/framework/cache/*
rm -rf storage/framework/sessions/*
rm -rf storage/framework/views/*

# Clear logs
echo "Clearing logs..."
rm -rf storage/logs/*

# Optional: Remove and reinstall dependencies (uncomment if needed)
# echo "Removing vendor and node_modules..."
# rm -rf vendor node_modules

echo "✅ Cleanup complete!"
echo ""
echo "To reinstall dependencies:"
echo "  docker-compose exec app composer install"
echo "  docker-compose exec app npm install"
```

Make it executable:
```bash

## 🎯 Quick Answer

### Why These Folders Were Created?

- **`.cache`** - Created by Composer for faster package downloads
- **`.config`** - Created by Composer for configuration
- **`.local`** - Created by Composer for local data

These are NOT part of your Laravel project. They're Composer's internal directories.

### Which Can I Delete?

**Safe to delete:**
- ✅ `.cache` - Composer cache
- ✅ `.config` - Composer config
- ✅ `.local` - Composer local data

**DO NOT delete:**
- ❌ `docker/` - Required for Docker
- ❌ Any other Laravel core folders

### How to Clean Up?

```bash
# Delete Composer cache folders
rm -rf .cache .config .local

# They will be recreated next time you run composer
```

---

## 📝 Update .gitignore

Add these to your `.gitignore` to prevent committing them:

```gitignore
# Composer cache
.cache/
.config/
.local/

# Laravel cache (already in .gitignore)
bootstrap/cache/*
storage/framework/cache/*
storage/framework/sessions/*
storage/framework/views/*
```

These folders are temporary and shouldn't be tracked in Git.

---

## ✅ Summary

**The folders `.cache`, `.config`, and `.local` are:**
- ✅ Safe to delete
- ✅ Created by Composer automatically
- ✅ Not part of your Laravel application
- ✅ Should be ignored in Git

**The `docker/` folder is:**
- ❌ Important - Keep it!
- ✅ Required for Docker setup
- ✅ Contains Nginx and PHP configuration

**Recommendation:**
Delete `.cache`, `.config`, and `.local` folders. They're just Composer's temporary files and will be recreated automatically.
